Hey, feature suggestion for you AMIZING program for stuck rounds:
	
Add Playerid (and if possible in both encrypted and decrypted forms, but at least one).
	Add last login date (from the players table) - Or at least let me know if you check if the player has logged in since the stuck round.
	Add debit amount 

Just to clarify. The first point is pretty important (when contacting outside NG). The other points are more like a commodity.
